Extremely unbalanced dataset obtained from Kaggle - achieved a recall score for the minority class of 99% and macro F1-score of 77%. 
Recall is the most important in this case, especially for the positive class since avoiding false negatives will ensure patient has been diagnosed as 
having no stroke and in reality has no stroke! I implemented several different ML models of which Naive Bayes and Stochastic Gradient Descent performed best.
Using these, I employed a voting classifier with three different models, namely Naive Bayes, Stochastic Gradient Descent and Gradient Boosting to obtain best results.

Context


According to the World Health Organization (WHO) stroke is the 2nd leading cause of death globally, responsible for approximately 11% of total deaths.
This dataset is used to predict whether a patient is likely to get stroke based on the input parameters like gender, age, various diseases, and smoking status. Each row in the data provides relavant information about the patient.

Attribute Information
1) id: unique identifier
2) gender: "Male", "Female" or "Other"
3) age: age of the patient
4) hypertension: 0 if the patient doesn't have hypertension, 1 if the patient has hypertension
5) heart_disease: 0 if the patient doesn't have any heart diseases, 1 if the patient has a heart disease
6) ever_married: "No" or "Yes"
7) work_type: "children", "Govt_jov", "Never_worked", "Private" or "Self-employed"
8) Residence_type: "Rural" or "Urban"
9) avg_glucose_level: average glucose level in blood
10) bmi: body mass index
11) smoking_status: "formerly smoked", "never smoked", "smokes" or "Unknown"*
12) stroke: 1 if the patient had a stroke or 0 if not
*Note: "Unknown" in smoking_status means that the information is unavailable for this patient.
